=> React.js
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

JSX=>> JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. 
Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.

In javascript, the behaviour of “this” keyword is based on how a function is called. 
“this” holds the reference to current execution context in javascript. Depending on how a function is called,
this can refer to different objects.

DOM=>> The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the 
structure and content of a document on the web.
A DOM, or Document Object Model, acts as a translator between Javascript and HTML.

JSON=>> JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text-based open standard data interchange setup and only 
provides a data encoding specification. It is derived from a subset of the JavaScript programming language.

HOOKS=>> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside 
classes — they let you use React without classes. (We don't recommend rewriting your existing components 
overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new ones if you'd like.)
